# DNA-Barcoding-for-Species-Classification
Encoding DNA Barcode dataset for classifying plant species using various deep learning techniques.

DNA barcodes with short sequence fragments are used for species identification. DNA sequences from different organisms are easily and rapidly acquired. Therefore, DNA sequence analysis tools play an increasingly crucial role in species identification. Here, we use raw sequence data as the input to represent one-hot encoding as a one-dimensional image. 
For classification of species uses a deep convolutional neural network has been used. It can achieve an average accuracy of >90 percent for both simulation and real datasets. Along with it, some machine learning models have also been tested.

## Content:
--> The data is store in csv format. It has already been encoded. The four files have seperate train and test files.
--> All the models have been provided in the "Models" folder. It also contains the preprocessing and encoding part.
--> Some refernce papers have also been shared in the above folder.
